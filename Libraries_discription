ðŸ§° Libraries Used and Their Descriptions
1. Pandas (import pandas as pd)
Purpose:
Pandas is the core library for data manipulation and analysis.

Used for:

Reading and loading the dataset (read_csv)

Handling missing values (isnull, fillna, dropna)

Data filtering and slicing

Grouping and aggregating data (groupby, value_counts)

DataFrame operations (creating new columns, merging, etc.)

2. NumPy (import numpy as np)
Purpose:
NumPy is used for numerical operations and handling arrays.

Used for:

Working with missing data (np.nan)

Numerical conversions and mathematical operations

Efficient data manipulation when working with numerical features

3. Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
Purpose:
Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Used for:

Creating basic visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, line plots

Customizing plot elements (titles, axes, legends)

Displaying plots (plt.show())

4. Seaborn (import seaborn as sns)
Purpose:
Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and simplifies statistical plotting with a cleaner design.

Used for:

Creating advanced visualizations like heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots, histograms, scatterplots

Aesthetic styling of plots for better readability

Handling categorical vs numerical plotting

5. WordCloud (from wordcloud import WordCloud)
Purpose:
WordCloud is used to generate word clouds â€” a visual representation of text data.

Used for:

Creating visual frequency maps of the most common cuisines or restaurant types

Presenting textual patterns in an appealing and digestible format
